## Market Power

- When an individual agent can affect the price (or other outcome) that prevails in the market, the agent has market power

- A monopoly market consists of a single seller facing many buyers

- A monopsony market consists of a single buyer facing many sellers

## Monopoly

- In contrast to a perfectly competitive firm, a monopolist sets the market price of its product (market power)

- The demand curve stops the monopolist from setting an infinitely high price by imposing a trade-off 
    - The higher the price, the lower the quantity it sells
    - The lower the price, the higher the quantity it sells

## Monopolist's Demand Curve

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column}
- The monopolist's demand curve is the market demand curve

- The profit-maximizing monopolist's problem is finding the optimal trade-off between volume and margin (difference between price and marginal cost)

## Monopolist's Problem

The monopolist's profit-maximization problem :
$$
\begin{aligned}
\max_Q \pi(Q)&=TR(Q)-TC(Q) \\
\text{s.t. }& TR(Q)=QP(Q)
\end{aligned}
$$ {#eq-monopoly-prob}

- where $P(Q)$ is the inverse market demand

## Optimality Condition

1. Profits are maximized at $Q^*$ such that $MR(Q^*)=MC(Q^*)$

1. Slope of the $MC$ curve exceeds the slope of the $MR$ curve

## Marginal Revenue

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}

- $MR(Q)=\frac{d TR(Q)}{dQ}$
    - $=P+Q\frac{dP(Q)}{dQ}$

- $MR = \frac{\Delta TR}{\Delta Q}=\frac{P\Delta Q+Q\Delta P}{\Delta Q}$
    - $=P+Q\frac{\Delta P}{\Delta Q}$

## Marginal Revenue 

![Competitive firms is not affected by the change in price due to its change in output](figures/mono_vs_competitive.png){fig-align="center"}

## Marginal Revenue

- Marginal revenue has two parts:
    - $P$: increase in revenue due to higher volume -the *marginal* units
    - $Q(dP(Q)/dQ)$: decrease in revenue due to reduced price of the inframarginal units (negative)

- The marginal revenue is less than the price the monopolist can charge to sell that quantity for any $Q\ge0$ because $dP(Q)/dQ\le0$

- MR can be positive or negative

## Marginal Revenue {.scrollable}

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="40%"}

- $AR(Q)=TR(Q)/Q$
    - $=QP(Q)/Q=P(Q)$

- $MR(Q) \le P(Q)$
    - $\implies MR(Q) \le AR(Q)$

## Profit-Maximization Condition

Suppose the monopolist faces a linear demand curve

$$
P(Q)=a-bQ
$$

Then, the revenue function is

$$
TR(Q)=QP(Q)=aQ-bQ^2
$$

and the marginal revenue function is

$$
MR(Q)=a-2bQ
$$

## Profit-Maximization Condition

![](figures/mono_linear_demand.png){fig-align="center" width="70%"}

## Monopoly vs Competitive Market

- $P_M>MC_M$, in general $P_M > P_{PC}$
- $Q^*_{M} < Q^*_{PC}$
- $\pi_{M}\ge0$
- Consumers are worse off but the firm is better off. What's best?


## Monopoly is not Pareto Efficient

- **Pareto Efficiency:** There is no way to make someone better off without making somebody else worse off

- **Inverse demand curve:** At each level of output, $P(Q)$ measures how much people are willing to pay for an additional unit of the good

## Monopoly is not Pareto Efficient

- Since $P(Q)\ge MC(Q)$ for all output levels between $Q_M$ and $Q_C$

- There is a range of consumers that are willing to pay $\bar P$ for an extra unit of output, such that $P(Q)>\bar P> MC(Q)$  [(area under demand curve between $Q_M$ and $Q_C$ and above the $MC(Q)$)]{.small}

## Inefficiency of Monopoly

- Any of these consumers would be better off because they are willing to pay $P(Q)$ but the extra unit of output is sold at $\bar P < P(Q)$

- Likewise, the firm would be better off because it cost $MC(Q)$ to produce the extra unit of output and the firms sold it for $\bar P > MC(Q)$[(all the other units of output are being sold for the same price $P_M$ as before)]{.small}

- We found a Pareto improvement!

## Inefficiency of Monopoly [(continued)]{.small}

![](figures/mono_ineff.png){fig-align="center"}

## Welfare Economics of Monopoly

- How inefficient is a Monopoly?

- Compare changes in producer's and consumer's surplus from a movement from Monopoly to Perfect Competition

- Change in producer's surplus —firm's profits— measures how much the owners would be willing to pay to get the higher price under monopoly

- Change in consumers' surplus measures how much the consumers would have to be paid to compensate them for the higher price

## Deadweight Loss of Monopoly

![](figures/DL_mono.png){fig-align="center"}

## Deadweight Loss of Monopoly

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column}

- Producer loses A, but gains C

- Consumer gains A and B

- A is just a transfer; total surplus does not change

- B+C is a real gain in surplus
:::
::: {.column}
- Deadweight Loss of Monopoly (B+C) measures how much worse off people are paying the monopoly price than paying the competitive price

- DWL values each unit of lost output at the price that people are willing to pay for that unit

:::
::::

## No Unique Supply Curve for Monopolists

- In Competitive Markets, $P=MC(Q)$, there is a unique relationship between the quantity produced by the firm and price $Q=MC^{-1}(P)$

- In Monopoly, $P+Q\frac{dP(Q)}{dQ}=MC(Q)$

- Depending on the shape of the demand curve,$\frac{dP(Q)}{dQ}$, the monopolist might produce the same quantity at two different prices or produce different quantities at the same price

    - no unique relationship between $Q$ and $P$, $\implies$ no unique supply curve

## No Unique Supply Curve

![](figures/supply_curve_mono.png){fig-align="center"}

## Price Elasticity of Demand

$$
\begin{aligned}
    MR(Q)&=P+Q\frac{dP(Q)}{dQ} \\
    &=P\left(1+\frac{Q}{P}\frac{dP(Q)}{dQ} \right)\\
    &=P\left(1+\frac{1}{\frac{P}{Q}\frac{dQ}{dP}}\right)\\
    &=P\left(1+\frac{1}{\epsilon_{Q,P}}\right) \\
    &=P\left(1-\frac{1}{|\epsilon_{Q,P}|}\right) \text{(because $\epsilon_{Q,P}<0$)}
\end{aligned}
$$

## Price Elasticity of Demand {#price-elasticity-demand}

| Elasticity | Marginal Revenue | Output and Profits |
|:----------:|:--:|:-----------------:|
| $|\epsilon_{Q,P}|<1$   | $MR<0$ | Reducing output increases revenue and reduces cost, so profits necessarily increase |
| $|\epsilon_{Q,P}|\ge1$ | $MR\ge 0$ | Increasing output increases revenue but cost increase, optimal output lies here |
|  $|\epsilon_{Q,P}|=\infty$ | $MR=P$ | Competitive case |

    [&#10148; Optimality Condition Graph](#optimality-condition-1)
]{.footer}

## Elastic Part of the Curve

- Monopolists will never choose to operate where the demand is *inelastic*

1. $MC\ge0$, at the optimum $MR=MC\ge0$, but $|\epsilon_{Q,P}|<1 \implies MR <0$

1. Any point were $|\epsilon_{Q,P}|<1$ cannot be a profit maximum, since the monopolist could increase profits by producing less output

## Pricing Rule

Profit maximizing condition is $MR = MC$ with $P^*$ and $Q^*$

$$
\begin{aligned}
𝑀𝑅(𝑄^∗ )&=𝑀𝐶(𝑄^∗ ) \\
𝑃^∗ \left(1-\frac{1}{|\epsilon_{𝑄,𝑃}|}\right)&=𝑀𝐶(𝑄^∗)
\end{aligned}
$$

Rearranging and setting MR(Q*) = MC(Q*)
$$
\frac{(𝑃^∗−𝑀C^∗)}{𝑃^∗} =\frac{1}{ |\epsilon_{𝑄,𝑃}| }
$$

**Inverse elasticity pricing rule (IEPR):** The less price elastic the demand, the higher the optimal markup

## Demand Elasticity {.centered}

![Market B is less price elastic than A, thus the markup is higher in B than in A](figures/markups_elasticity.png)

## Market Power

- When a firm can exercise some degree of control over its price in the market, we say that it has market power

- Monopolists or producers of differentiated products will, in general, charge prices that exceed their marginal cost

- A natural measure of market power is $(P − MC)/P$
    - Lerner Index 

- The Lerner Index is zero for a perfectly competitive industry. It is positive for any industry that departs from perfect competition. 

## Market Power

- The IEPR tells us that in the equilibrium of a monopoly market, the Lerner Index will be inversely related to the market price elasticity of demand. 

- An important driver of the price elasticity of demand is the threat of substitute products outside the industry

- If a monopoly market faces strong competition from substitute products, the Lerner Index can still be low. In other words, a firm might have a monopoly, but its market power might still be weak.


## Why Monopolies Exist?

- A market is a *natural monopoly* if the total cost incurred by a single firm producing output is less than the combined total cost of two or more firms producing this same level of output among them

- Necessary conditions
    - Economies of scale
    - Demand

## Natural Monopoly

![It is cheaper for 1 firm to produce 9 than for two to produce 4.5](figures/natural_mono.png){fig-align="center"}


## Barriers to entry

- Factors that allow an incumbent firm to earn positive economic profits while making it unprofitable for newcomers to enter the industry

- **Structural** barriers to entry occur when incumbent firms have cost
or demand advantages that would make it unattractive for a new firm to
enter the industry

- **Legal** barriers to entry exist when an incumbent firm is legally
protected against competition

- **Strategic** barriers to entry result when an incumbent firm takes
explicit steps to deter entry

## Monopsony

- A monopsony market consists of a single buyer facing many sellers

- The monopsonist's profit maximization problem:
    - $\max \pi = TR – TC = Pf(L) – w(L)L$
    - where: $Pf(L)$ is the total revenue for the monopsonist 
    - and $w(L)L$ is the total cost

- The monopsonist's profit maximization condition:
    - $MRP_L = ME_L$ 
    - $P \times MP_L = dTC/dL$
    - $P (dQ/dL) = w + L (dw/dL)$

## Inverse Elasticity Pricing Rule

- Monopsony equilibrium condition results in:
    - $(MRP_L−w)/w=1/\epsilon_{L,w}$
    - where: $\epsilon_{L,w}$ is the price elasticity of labor supply, $(w/L)(dL/dw)$

## Price Elasticity of Demand [REVIEW]{.small} {#app-e_QP}

::: {.nonincremental}
- The price elasticity of demand is the percentage change in quantity demanded due to a one-percent change in the price of the good

- $\epsilon_{Q,P}=\frac{Δ𝑄/𝑄}{Δ𝑃/𝑃}=\frac{Δ𝑄}{Δ𝑃}\frac{𝑃}{𝑄}$

- Elasticity is not the slope:

    - Slope measures the *absolute change* in quantity due to *one-unit* change price $(Δ𝑄⁄Δ𝑃)$

    - Elasticity measures the relative (or percentage) change in quantity due to *one percent* change price
:::

## Price Elasticity of Demand

| $ϵ_{Q,P}$ | Classification | Meaning                 |
|:------------------:|:--------------:|:------------------------|
|$|ϵ_{Q,P}|<1$ | Inelastic demand	| Quantity demanded is relatively insensitive to price. |
| $|ϵ_{Q,P}|\ge1$| Elastic demand | Quantity demanded is relatively sensitive to price.|
$|ϵ_{Q,P}|=\infty$ | Perfectly elastic demand | Any increase in price results in quantity demanded decreasing to zero, and any decrease in price results in quantity demanded increasing to infinity. |
