## Chapter 13 Overview

- What happens when there is more than one seller, but still there are few enough to affect the market?
- How do their choices affect each other?
- Will they cooperate? Will they compete?
- What happens if their products are imperfect substitutes?

## Objectives

- Describing and Measuring Market Structure
- Oligopoly with Homogeneous Products
- Dominant Firm Markets
- Oligopoly with Horizontally Differentiated Products
- Monopolistic Competition
- The Cournot Equilibrium and the Inverse Elasticity Pricing Rule

## Market Structures: 2 Key Dimensions {.smaller}

| Market Structure          | Number of Firms | Type of Product         | Control Over Price     | Examples      |
|---------------------------|-----------------|-------------------------|------------------------|---------------|
| Perfect Competition       | Many            | Homogeneous             | None                   | Agriculture (US)  |
| Monopolistic Competition  | Many            | Differentiated          | Some                   | Retail stores |
| Oligopoly                  | Few             | Homogeneous or Differentiated | Some to Significant | Banking-Big 5 (CA)   |

: Market Structures Characteristics

## Measures of Market Structure

- Four-Firm Concentration Ratio (4CR): The share of industry sales revenue accounted for by the four firms with the largest sales revenue in the industry

- Herfindahl–Hirschman Index (HHI): The sum of the squares of the market share of each firm in the industry ($0 \le HHI \le 10,000$)

- 
  | Market Structure | 4CR | HHI |
  |:-----------------|:---:|:----:|
  | Perfect Competition | Low | Low |
  | Olygopoly           | Intermediate | Intermediate |
  | Monopoly            | 100     |   10,000 |


## Oligopoly with Homogeneous Goods

- A central feature of oligopoly markets: competitive interdependence
    - The decisions of every firm significantly affect the profits of competitors
    - Perfect Competition: No impact of one firm on its rivals
    - Monopolist: No rivals

- Central question of oligopoly theory: how does the close interdependence among firms in the market affect their behavior?

## The Cournot Model

- 2 firms (duopoly); one homogeneous good
- Both with identical marginal costs
- Firms choose output (how much to produce)
    - simultaneously
    - non-cooperatively (no collusion)
    - no knowledge of each other's plan 

## The Cournot Model

- Inverse demand is downward-slopping and a function of the combined output of the two firms, $P(Q_1+Q_2)$
    - Price is not known until both firms have made their output choice
- Each firm will produce the output choice that maximizes its profit based on its **expectation** of the other firm's output choice

## Residual Demand

- Suppose firm 1 expects that firm 2 will produce $Q^e_2$
- If firm 1 produces $Q_1$, then total output will be $Q=Q_1+Q_2^e$, and
- and market price will be $P(Q)=P(Q_1+Q_2^e)$
- the inverse market demand resulting from holding their rivals' output constant is the **residual demand** 
    - Ex. Linear Demand 
      $$
      P(Q)=a-b(Q_1+Q_2^e)=(a-bQ_2^e)-bQ_1
      $$

## Residual Demand

```{python}
#| label: fig-residual
#| fig-cap: Residual demand
#| eval: false
#| include: false

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# Market demand function P(Q)
def market_demand(Q1,Q2):
    return 100 - Q1-Q2

# Total quantity produced by other firms
Q_other = 30

# Total market quantity
Q = np.arange(0, 100, 1)
P = market_demand(Q,0)

# Residual demand for firm i (considering Q_other produced by other firms)
Q_i = np.arange(0, 70, 1)
P_i = market_demand(Q_i, Q_other)

# Plotting

plt.plot(Q, P, label='Market Demand')
plt.plot(Q_i, P_i, label='Residual Demand for Firm i')

plt.axvline(x=60, ymin=0, ymax=10,color='red', linestyle='--', label='Price')
plt.axvline(x=90, ymin=0, ymax=10,color='red', linestyle='--', label='Price')
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

## Best Response

- When choosing output, each firm will act as a monopolist relative to its *residual demand*

- Firm 1 maximizes its profit by choosing $Q_1$ that maximizes:
  $$
  \pi_1=P(Q_1+Q_2^e)⋅Q_1−C(Q_1)
  $$

- **Best Response**: For any given belief about the output of firm 2, $Q^e_2$, there is an optimal choice of output for firm 1,
  $$
    Q_1=BR_1(Q^e_2)
  $$

## Reaction Function

- The best response function for Firm 1, $BR_1(Q_2^e)$, is derived by setting:
  $$
  \frac{\partial \pi_1}{\partial Q_1} = 0
  $$

- **Example with Linear Demand**:
  Assuming $P(Q) = a - b(Q_1 + Q_2)$ and constant marginal cost $MC = c$, the reaction functions can be simplified as:
  $$
  \begin{aligned}    
    Q_1= \frac{a - c}{2b} - \frac{Q_2^e}{2} \;;\;
    Q_2= \frac{a - c}{2b} - \frac{Q_1^e}{2}
  \end{aligned}
  $$

## Cournot Equilibrium

- Cournot Equilibrium: each firm maximizes its profits, given its beliefs about the other firm's output choice, and those beliefs are confirmed in equilibrium
    - Each firm optimally produces the output its rival expects it to produce
    - No firm has incentives to deviate 
- Mathematically, a combination of output choices $(Q_1^*,Q_2^*)$ that satisfy
  $$
    \begin{aligned}
        Q^*_1= \frac{a - c}{2b} - \frac{Q_2^*}{2} \;;\;
        Q^*_2= \frac{a - c}{2b} - \frac{Q_1^*}{2}
    \end{aligned}
  $$

## Cournot Equilibrium (Two-Firm Case)

- **Cournot Equilibrium for Two Firms**: Occurs where the reaction curves of Firm 1 and Firm 2 intersect.

- **Equilibrium Output**:
  Solving the system of equations given by the reaction functions yields the equilibrium outputs for both firms:
  $$
  Q_1^* = Q_2^* = \frac{a - c}{3b}
  $$
  and the total market output is:
  $$
  Q^* = Q_1^* + Q_2^* = \frac{2(a - c)}{3b}
  $$

## Achieving Equilibrium

![**In the Cournot equilibrium** both firms fully understand their interdependence and have confidence in each other's rationality](book-figures/c13/c13f003.png){fig-align="center" width="80%"}

## Cournot vs Monopoly

![By independently maximizing their own profits, firms produce more total output than they would if they collusively maximized industry profits (Monopoly).](book-figures/c13/c13f004.png){fig-align="center" width="80%"}

## Cournot for N-firms

- For $N$ identical firms, each firm $i$ will produce 
  $$
    Q^*_i = \frac{1}{N+1}\frac{a - c}{b}
  $$

- Total market output and market price will be
  $$
    Q^*=\sum_i Q^*_i = \frac{N}{N+1}\frac{(a - c)}{b}
  $$
  $$
    P^*=a-b\left(\frac{N}{N+1}\frac{(a - c)}{b} \right) = \frac{a+Nc}{(N+1)}
  $$

## Comparing Market Structures

| Market Structure | $N$ | Optimal Firm Output $Q^*_i$ | Total Market Output $Q^*$ | Market Price $P^*$ |
|------------------|-------|------------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------|
| Monopoly         | 1     | $\frac{a - c}{2b}$         | $\frac{a - c}{2b}$        | $\frac{a + c}{2}$ |
| Cournot Duopoly  | 2     | $\frac{a - c}{3b}$         | $\frac{2(a - c)}{3b}$     | $\frac{(a + 2c)}{3}$ |
| Perfect Competition | $\infty$ | 0 (virtually)        | $\frac{a - c}{b}$         | $c$                  |

## Comparing Market Structures

- **Monopoly**: A single firm controls the entire market, producing half the competitive output and selling at a higher price.
- **Cournot Duopoly**: Two firms share the market, leading to increased output and lower prices compared to monopoly.
- **Perfect Competition**: An infinite number of firms produce at marginal cost, leading to the highest output and lowest price.
