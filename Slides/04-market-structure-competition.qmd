: Market Structures Characteristics

## Measures of Market Structure

- Four-Firm Concentration Ratio (4CR): The share of industry sales revenue accounted for by the four firms with the largest sales revenue in the industry

- Herfindahl–Hirschman Index (HHI): The sum of the squares of the market share of each firm in the industry ($0 \le HHI \le 10,000$)

- 
  | Market Structure | 4CR | HHI |
  |:-----------------|:---:|:----:|
  | Perfect Competition | Low | Low |
  | Olygopoly           | Intermediate | Intermediate |
  | Monopoly            | 100     |   10,000 |


## Oligopoly with Homogeneous Goods

- A central feature of oligopoly markets: competitive interdependence
    - The decisions of every firm significantly affect the profits of competitors
    - Perfect Competition: No impact of one firm on its rivals
    - Monopolist: No rivals

- Central question of oligopoly theory: how does the close interdependence among firms in the market affect their behavior?

## The Cournot Model

- 2 firms (duopoly); one homogeneous good
- Both with identical marginal costs
- Firms choose output (how much to produce)
    - simultaneously
    - non-cooperatively (no collusion)
    - no knowledge of each other's plan 

## The Cournot Model

- Inverse demand is downward-slopping and a function of the combined output of the two firms, $P(Q_1+Q_2)$
    - Price is not known until both firms have made their output choice
- Each firm will produce the output choice that maximizes its profit based on its **expectation** of the other firm's output choice

## Residual Demand

- Suppose firm 1 expects that firm 2 will produce $Q^e_2$
- If firm 1 produces $Q_1$, then total output will be $Q=Q_1+Q_2^e$, and
- and market price will be $P(Q)=P(Q_1+Q_2^e)$
- the inverse market demand resulting from holding their rivals' output constant is the **residual demand** 
    - Ex. Linear Demand 
      $$
      P(Q)=a-b(Q_1+Q_2^e)=(a-bQ_2^e)-bQ_1
      $$

## Residual Demand

![](figures/residual-demand.png){fig-align="center"}

## Example

- Inverse demand curve $P(Q)=100-Q$
- $MC=10$
- Firm 1 is Samsung and Firm 2 is SK
- If $Q=80$, then $P(80)=20$
- If $Q^e_2=50$, then $P(Q_1+50)=(100-50)-Q_1$
  - for $Q_1=30$, $P(30+50)=20$

## Best Response

- When choosing output, each firm will act as a monopolist relative to its *residual demand*

- Firm 1 maximizes its profit by choosing $Q_1$ that maximizes:
  $$
  \pi_1=P(Q_1+Q_2^e)⋅Q_1−C(Q_1)
  $$

- **Best Response**: For any given belief about the output of firm 2, $Q^e_2$, there is an optimal choice of output for firm 1,
  $$
    Q_1=BR_1(Q^e_2)
  $$

## Reaction Function

- The best response function for Firm 1, $BR_1(Q_2^e)$, is derived by setting:
  $$
  \frac{\partial \pi_1}{\partial Q_1} = 0
  $$

- **Example with Linear Demand**:
  Assuming $P(Q) = a - b(Q_1 + Q_2)$ and constant marginal cost $MC = c$, the reaction functions can be simplified as:
  $$
  \begin{aligned}    
    Q_1= \frac{a - c}{2b} - \frac{Q_2^e}{2} \;;\;
    Q_2= \frac{a - c}{2b} - \frac{Q_1^e}{2}
  \end{aligned}
  $$

## Reaction Function

## Example [(continued)]{.small}

- With $P(Q)=100-Q$ and $MC=10$
- 
  $$
    Q_1=45-\frac{Q^e_2}{2} \;;\;Q_2=45-\frac{Q^e_1}{2}
  $$

## Cournot Equilibrium

- Cournot Equilibrium: each firm maximizes its profits, given its beliefs about the other firm's output choice, and those beliefs are confirmed in equilibrium
    - Each firm optimally produces the output its rival expects it to produce
    - No firm has incentives to deviate 
- Mathematically, a combination of output choices $(Q_1^*,Q_2^*)$ that satisfy
  $$
    \begin{aligned}
        Q^*_1= \frac{a - c}{2b} - \frac{Q_2^*}{2} \;;\;
        Q^*_2= \frac{a - c}{2b} - \frac{Q_1^*}{2}
    \end{aligned}
  $$

## Cournot Equilibrium

- **Cournot Equilibrium for Two Firms**: Occurs where the reaction curves of Firm 1 and Firm 2 intersect.

- **Equilibrium Output**:
  Solving the system of equations given by the reaction functions yields the equilibrium outputs for both firms:
  $$
  Q_1^* = Q_2^* = \frac{a - c}{3b}
  $$
  and the total market output is:
  $$
  Q^* = Q_1^* + Q_2^* = \frac{2(a - c)}{3b}
  $$

## Example [(continued)]{.small}

- Continuing with our example $P=100-Q$ and $MC=10$

- Firm output is $Q_i=30$, total market output is $Q=60$

- So, market price is $P=40$

## Achieving Equilibrium

![**In the Cournot equilibrium** both firms fully understand their interdependence and have confidence in each other's rationality](book-figures/c13/c13f003.png){fig-align="center" width="80%"}


## Cournot for N-firms

- For $N$ identical firms, total output is $Q=\sum_i^N Q_i$

- Firm $i$ solves
  $$
    \max_{Q_i} P(Q)⋅Q_i-C(Q_i)
  $$ {#eq-n-cournot}

- For linear demand, and $MC=c$, each firm $i$ will produce 
  $$
    Q^*_i = \frac{1}{N+1}\frac{a - c}{b}
  $$

## Cournot for N-firms

- Total market output and market price will be
  $$
    Q^*=\sum_i Q^*_i = \frac{N}{N+1}\frac{(a - c)}{b}
  $$
  $$
    P^*=a-b\left(\frac{N}{N+1}\frac{(a - c)}{b} \right) = \frac{a+Nc}{(N+1)}
  $$

## Comparing Market Structures

| Market Structure | $N$ | Optimal Firm Output $Q^*_i$ | Total Market Output $Q^*$ | Market Price $P^*$ |
|------------------|-------|------------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------|
| Monopoly         | 1     | $\frac{a - c}{2b}$         | $\frac{a - c}{2b}$        | $\frac{a + c}{2}$ |
| Cournot Duopoly  | 2     | $\frac{a - c}{3b}$         | $\frac{2(a - c)}{3b}$     | $\frac{(a + 2c)}{3}$ |
| Perfect Competition | $\infty$ | 0 (virtually)        | $\frac{a - c}{b}$         | $c$                  |

## Comparing Market Structures

- **Monopoly**: A single firm controls the entire market, producing half the competitive output and selling at a higher price.
- **Cournot Duopoly**: Two firms share the market, leading to increased output and lower prices compared to monopoly.
- **Perfect Competition**: An infinite number of firms produce at marginal cost, leading to the highest output and lowest price.

## Cournot vs Monopoly

![By independently maximizing their own profits, firms produce more total output than they would if they collusively maximized industry profits (Monopoly).](book-figures/c13/c13f004.png){fig-align="center" width="80%"}

## Cournot and Elasticity of Demand

- FOC of @eq-n-cournot gives
  $$
    P(Q)+\frac{\partial P}{\partial Q}⋅Q_i=MC(Q_i)
  $$

- It can be shown that
  $$
    P(Q)\left[1-\frac{1}{|\epsilon_{Q,P}|/s_i}\right]=MC(Q_i)
  $$
  where $s_i=Q_i/Q$ is the market share

## Cournot and Elasticity of Demand

- $|\epsilon_{Q,P}|/s_i$, the elasticity of the demand curve facing the firm:
  - the smaller the market share of the firm, the more elastic the demand curve it faces

-
  | $s_i$ | Demand Curve | Condition | Market Structure|
  |-------|--------------|-----------|-----------------|
  | 0     | Flat         | $P=MC$      | Perfect Competition|
  | 1     | Market Demand| $P(1-\frac{1}{|\epsilon_{Q,P}|})=MC$ | Monopoly|

# Bertrand Competition

## Simultaneous Price Setting

- **Price Competition**: Unlike Cournot, where firms compete by choosing quantities, in the Bertrand model, firms compete by setting prices and letting the market determine the quantity sold. Simultaneous, non-cooperative.
- **Homogeneous Products**: Firms produce identical products, making price the sole factor for consumers when choosing between firms
- **Cost Structures**: Firms have identical cost structures and sufficient capacity to meet all demand
- **Rational Expectations**: Firms are profit-maximizers and have rational expectations about their competitors' behavior

## Bertrand Model

- **Profit Maximization for Firm 1**:
  $$
  \pi_1 = P_1 \cdot Q_1(P_1, P_2) -C(Q_1(P_1,P_2))
  $$
  - where $P_1$ is the price set by Firm 1, 
  - $C(Q_1(P_1,P_2))$ is cost function for Firm 1, and 
  - $Q_1(P_1, P_2)$ is the demand for Firm 1's product as a function of both firms' prices

## Demand Scenarios for Firm 1

1. **When $P_1 = P_2$**:
    - If both firms set equal prices, we assume demand is split equally between them. Hence, $Q_1 =Q_2 = \frac{1}{2}Q(P_2)$, where $Q(P_2)$ is the total market demand at price $P_2$
2. **When $P_1 > P_2$**:
    - Firm 1 captures none of the market demand since consumers prefer the cheaper, identical product from Firm 2. Thus, $Q_1 = 0$
3. **When $P_1 < P_2$**:
    - Firm 1 captures the entire market demand because its price is lower. Hence, $Q_1 = Q(P_1)$

## Residual Demand Bertrand
$$
Q_1 = 
\begin{cases} 
  0                 ,& P_1>P_2 \\
  \frac{1}{2}Q(P_2) ,& P_1=P_2 \\
  Q(P_1)            ,& P_1 < P_2
\end{cases}
$$

## Example [(continued)]{.small}

![](book-figures/c13/c13f005.png){fig-align="center"}

## Bertrand Equilibrium

- **Definition**: The Bertrand equilibrium is reached when each firm sets its price such that it maximizes its profits and neither firm can increase profits by unilaterally changing its price.

- **Reaching the Bertrand Equilibrium**:
  - With identical products and rational, profit-maximizing firms, the equilibrium occurs when both firms set their prices equal to marginal cost ($P = MC$).
  - If one firm undercuts the other by even a small amount, it captures the entire market. Thus, to avoid losing the market, firms race to the bottom, stopping at $P = MC$.

## Bertrand Equilibrium

- **Characteristics**:
  - The Bertrand equilibrium results in the competitive price level, even with only two firms in the market.
  - Total market supply meets all demand at this price level, as firms have sufficient capacity.

## Bertrand vs. Other Market Structures {.smaller}

- **Bertrand vs. Cournot**:
  - In Cournot competition, firms choose quantities, leading to higher prices than marginal costs due to the strategic reduction in total output.
  - In Bertrand competition, firms choose prices, leading to a price equal to marginal cost, similar to perfect competition outcomes, even with only two firms.

- **Bertrand and Perfect Competition**:
  - Both result in prices equal to marginal costs; however, perfect competition assumes an infinite number of firms, while Bertrand demonstrates that two firms are sufficient to reach competitive pricing under price competition.

## Implications for Market Outcomes
- **Cournot Model**: Higher prices and lower quantities than in perfect competition, with profits for each firm.
- **Bertrand Model**: Identical to perfect competition in terms of price and quantity, with no profits for each firm.
