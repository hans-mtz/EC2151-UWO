## Perfect Competition (Review)

- What is Perfect Competition?
- Profit Maximization by a Price-Taking Firm
- Short-Run vs. Long-Run Equilibrium
- Economic Rent and Producer Surplus
- Profit Maximization Implies Cost Minimization

## Perfectly Competitive Markets

- A perfectly competitive market consists of firms that produce identical products that sell at the same price

- Each firm’s volume of output is so small in comparison to the overall market demand that no single firm has an impact on the market price

## Perfectly Competitive Markets - Conditions

1. The industry is fragmented
    - It consists of many buyers and sellers

1. Firms produce undifferentiated products
    - Consumers perceive the products to be identical no matter who produces them

1. Consumers have perfect information about prices
    - The industry is characterized by equal access to resources

1. All firms —incumbents and prospective entrants— have access to the same technology and inputs

## Implications of Conditions

- The first characteristic implies that sellers and buyers act as price takers

- The second and third characteristics imply a law of one price

- The fourth characteristic implies that the industry is characterized by free entry

## The Profit Maximization Hypothesis

$$
\begin{align}
\max_{Q} \pi(Q)&=R(Q)-C(Q) \\
\text{s.t. } Q&\ge0
\end{align}
$$ {#eq-perf-comp}

- Economic Profit = Sales Revenue - Economic (Opportunity) Cost

- firm sells output Q; R(Q), revenue from selling the quantity; C(Q) = economic cost of producing the quantity Q

## The Profit Maximization Condition Continued

<!-- Since P is taken as given, firm chooses Q to maximize profit
Marginal Revenue: The rate which TR change with output
𝑀𝑅=∆𝑇𝑅/∆𝑄
Since firm is a price taker, increase in TR from 1 unit change in Q is equal to P
𝑀𝑅=∆𝑇𝑅/∆𝑄=∆(𝑃×𝑄)/∆𝑄=𝑃
Profit Maximization by a Price-Taking Firm
If P > MC then profit rises if output is increased
If P < MC then profit falls if output is increased.
Therefore, the profit maximization condition for a price-taking firm is P = MC
At profit maximizing point:
P = MC = MR
MC rising

Short-Run Equilibrium
The short-run is the period of time in which the firm’s plant size is fixed and the number of firms in the industry is fixed
STC(Q) = SFC + NSFC + TVC(q) for q > 0
STC(Q) = SFC for q = 0
SFC is the cost of the firm’s fixed input that are unavoidable at q = 0
Output insensitive for q > 0 = Sunk 
NSFC is the cost of the firm’s inputs that are avoidable if the firm produces zero (salaries of some employees, for example)
Output insensitive for q > 0 = Non-sunk
TFC = SFC + NSFC
TVC(q) are the output sensitive costs (and are non-sunk)
Short-Run Supply Curve (SRSC)
The firm’s short-run supply curve tells us how the profit maximizing output changes as the market price changes
Short Run Supply Curve: NSFC=0
If the firm chooses to produce a positive output, P = SMC defines the short run supply curve of the firm
But…

Shut Down Price
The firm will choose to produce a positive output only if:
(q) > (0) …or…
Pq – TVC(q) – TFC > -TFC
Pq – TVC(q) > 0
P > AVC(q)

The price below which the firm would opt to produce zero is called the shut down price, Ps
In this case, Ps is the minimum point on the AVC curve
Short Run Supply Function
Therefore, the firm’s short run supply function is defined by:
P=SMC, where SMC slopes upward as long as P > Ps
0 where P < Ps
This means that a perfectly competitive firm may choose to operate in the short run even if economic profit is negative

Cost Considerations
At prices below SAC but above AVC, profits are negative if the firm produces
But the firm loses less by producing than by shutting down because of sunk costs
Example:
STC(q)	= 100 + 20q + q2
TFC	= 100 (this is sunk)
TVC(q)	= 20q + q2
AVC(q)	= 20 + q
SMC(q)	= 20 + 2q

Cost Considerations Continued
The minimum level of AVC is the point where AVC = SMC or:
20+q = 20+2q
q = 0 
AVC minimized at 20
The firm’s short run supply curve is, then:
P < Ps = 20: qs = 0
P > Ps = 20: P = SMC
P = 20+2q  qs = 10 + ½P

SRSC When All Costs are Non-Sunk
If the firm chooses to produce a positive output, P = SMC defines the short run supply curve of the firm
But the firm will choose to produce a positive output only if:
(q) > (0) …or…
Pq – TVC(q) - TFC > 0
P > AVC(q) + AFC(q) = SAC(q)
Now, the shut down price, Ps is the minimum of the SAC curve

SRSC When All Costs are Non-Sunk: Example
STC(q) = F + 20q + q2
F = 100, all of which is sunk:
AVC(q) = 20 + q
SMC(q) = 20 + 2q
SAC(q) = 100/q + 20 + q
SAC = SMC at q = 10

At any P > 40, the firm earns positive economic profit
At any P < 40, the firm earns negative economic profit
Market Supply and Equilibrium
The market supply at any price is the sum of the quantities each firm supplies at that price
The short run market supply curve is the horizontal sum of the individual firm supply curves
Short Run Perfectly Completive Equilibrium
A short run perfectly competitive equilibrium occurs when the market quantity demanded equals the market quantity supplied
∑_(𝑖=1)^𝑛▒〖𝑄_𝑠^𝑖 (𝑃)=𝑄_𝑑 (𝑃) 〗
Qsi(P) is determined by the firm's individual profit maximization condition

Short Run Market Equilibrium
Short-run perfectly competitive equilibrium: The market price at which quantity demanded equals quantity supplied
Typical firm produces Q* where MR=MC and if 100 firms make up the market then market supply must equal 100Q*
Deriving a Short Run Market Equilibrium
300 Identical firms
Qd(P) = 60 – P
STC(q) = 0.1 + 150q2
SMC(q) = 300q
NSFC = 0
AVC(q) = 150q
Minimum AVC = 0 so as long as price is positive, firm will produce

Short run equilibrium
Profit maximization condition: 
P = 300q
qs(P) = P/300 and Qs(P) = 300(P/300) = P
Qs(P) = Qd(P)  P = 60 – P
P*= 30
q* = 30/300=.1
Q* = 30

Deriving a Short Run Market Equilibrium Continued
Do firms make positive profits at the market equilibrium?
SAC = STC/q = .1/q + 150q
When each firm produces .1, SAC per firm is:.1/.1 + 150(.1) = 16
Therefore, P* > SAC so profits are positive

Comparative Statics Analysis
An increase in the number of firms shifts the short-run supply curve rightward
The quantity supplied at any price goes up
The rightward shift drives the equilibrium price down and the equilibrium quantity up
Comparative Statics
In panel (a), supply is relatively elastic, and a shift in demand has a modest impact on price
In panel (b), supply is relatively inelastic, and the identical shift in demand has a more dramatic impact on the equilibrium price
When demand shifts, elasticity of supply matters
Long Run Market Equilibrium
The long run is the period of time in which all the firm’s inputs can be adjusted
The number of firms in the industry can change as well
The firm should use long run cost functions for evaluating the cost of outputs it might produce in this longer term period
In otherwords, decisions to modify plant size, enter or exit, change production process and so on would all be based on long term analysis

Firm’s Long Run Supply Curve
The firm’s long run supply curve:
P = MC for P > (min(AC) = Ps)
0 (exit) for P < (min(AC) = Ps)
At right, for prices greater that $0.20 the long-run supply curve is the long-run MC curve

Long-Run Equilibrium in a Perfectly Competitive Market
The long-run equilibrium price P* equals the minimum level of long-run average cost
$15 per unit
Each firm produces a quantity Q* equal to its minimum efficient scale
50,000 units
The equilibrium quantity demanded is 10 million units
The equilibrium number of firms is this amount divided by the output per firm of 50,000
n* = D(P*)/Q* = 10,000,000/50,000 = 200
Calculating Long-Run Equilibrium
TC(q) = 40q - q2 + .01q3
AC(q) = 40 – q + .01q2
MC(q) = 40 – 2q + .03q2
Qd(P) = 25000-1000P
The long run equilibrium satisfies the following:
a. P* = 40 – 2q* - .03q*2
b. P* = 40 – q* + .01q*2
c. 25000-1000P* = q*n*

Using (a) and (b), we have:
40 – 2q* + .03q*2 = 40-q*+.01q*2
q* = 50
P* = 15
Qd(P*) = 10000
Using (c) we have:
n* = 10000/50 = 200

Calculating Long-Run Equilibrium Continued
Summarizing long run equilibrium
“If anyone can do it, you can’t make money at it”
Or if the firm’s strategy is based on skills that can be easily imitated or resources that can be easily acquired, in the long run your economic profit will be competed away
Long-Run Market Supply Curve
We have calculated a point at which the market will be in long run equilibrium
This is a point on the long run market supply curve
This curve can be derived explicitly
The long run market supply curve tells us the total quantity of output that will be supplied at various market prices, assuming that all long run adjustments (plant, entry) take place

Long-Run Market Supply Curve Continued
Since new entry can occur in the long run, we cannot obtain the long run market supply curve by summing the long run supplies of current market participants 
Instead, we must construct the long run market supply curve
We reason that, in the long run, output expansion or contraction in the industry occurs along a horizontal line corresponding to the minimum level of long run average cost
If P > min(AC), entry would occur, driving price back to min(AC)
If P < min(AC), firms would earn negative profits and would supply nothing

Long-Run Market Supply Curve Continued
Constant-Cost Industry
An industry in which the increase or decrease of industry output does not affect the price of inputs
We can have a constant-cost industry even though firms do not have constant returns to scale
Increasing-Cost Industry
Increasing cost Industry: An industry which increases in industry output increase the price of inputs.
Especially if firms use industry specific inputs i.e. scarce inputs that are used only by firms in a particular industry and no other industry
Decreasing-Cost Industry
An industry in which increases in industry output decrease the prices of some or all inputs
Each firm’s average and marginal cost curves may fall, not because the firms produce with economies of scale, but because input prices fall when the industry produces more
Economic Rent
Economic Rent: The economics rent that is attributed to extraordinarily productive inputs whose supply is scarce
Difference between the maximum value is willing to pay for the services of the input and input’s reservation value
Reservation value: The returns that the owner of an input could get by deploying the input in its best alternative use outside the industry
Producer Surplus
Producer surplus is the area above the market supply curve and below the market price
It is a monetary measure of the benefit that producers derive from producing a good at a particular price.
Note that that the producer earns the price for every unit sold, but only incurs the SMC for each unit
This is why the difference between the P and SMC curve measures the total benefit derived from production
Further, since the market supply curve is simply the sum of the individual supply curves
Which equal the marginal cost curves the difference between price and the market supply curve measures the surplus of all producers in the market
Note that that producer’s surplus does not deduct fixed costs, so it does not equal profit
Producer Surplus Continued
Producer Surplus Continued
Producer surplus is area FBCE when price is $3.50
Change in producer surplus is area P1P2GH when price moves from P1 to P2
Producer Surplus in the Milk Market
Given Market supply curve and P is the price in dollars per gallon
Find producer surplus when price is $2.50 per gallon
How much does producer surplus when price of milk increases from $2.50 to $4.00 -->
