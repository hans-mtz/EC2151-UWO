## Perfect Competition (Review)

- What is Perfect Competition?
- Profit Maximization by a Price-Taking Firm
- Functional Forms
- Revealed Profitability
- Supply Curve of a Firm

## Perfectly Competitive Markets

- A perfectly competitive market consists of firms that produce **identical products** that sell at the **same price**

- Each firm’s volume of output is so small in comparison to the overall market demand that **no single firm has an impact on the market price**

## Perfectly Competitive Markets - Conditions

(@) The industry is **fragmented**
    - It consists of many buyers and sellers

(@) Firms produce **undifferentiated** products
    - Consumers perceive the products to be identical no matter who produces them

## Perfectly Competitive Markets - Conditions

(@) Consumers have **perfect information** about prices
    - The industry is characterized by equal access to resources

(@) All firms —incumbents and prospective entrants— have access to the **same technology** and inputs

## Implications of Conditions

- The first characteristic implies that sellers and buyers act as **price-takers**

- The second and third characteristics imply a law of **one price**

- The fourth characteristic implies that the industry is characterized by **free entry**

## The Profit Maximization Hypothesis

$$
\begin{align}
\max_{Q} \pi(Q)&=TR(Q)-TC(Q) \\
\text{s.t. } Q&\ge0
\end{align}
$$ {#eq-perf-comp}

- Economic Profit = Sales Revenue - Economic (Opportunity) Cost

- firm sells output Q; TR(Q), revenue from selling the quantity; TC(Q), economic cost of producing the quantity Q

## The Profit Maximization Condition Continued

- The profit maximization condition is

$$
\frac{dTR(Q)}{dQ}= \frac{dTC(Q)}{Q}
$$

- Marginal revenue equals marginal cost

## Functional Forms

- We can define our problem in several ways depending on the question we're interested in

1. Output quantities: $TR(Q)=PQ$ and $TC(Q)$

1. Input quantities: $TR(K,L)=Pf(K,L)$ and $TC(K,L)=rK+wL$

## Conditions for an interior optimum

- $\frac{dTC(Q)}{Q}$ should be increasing

- $\frac{df(\bar K,L)}{dL}$ should be decreasing

## Revealed Profitability



## Supply Curve of a firm


:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}
- The firm’s (short-run) supply function is defined by:

1. P=SMC, where SMC slopes upward as long as P > Ps

1. 0 where P < Ps
