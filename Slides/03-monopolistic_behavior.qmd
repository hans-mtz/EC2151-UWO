## Capturing Surplus

- First-Degree Price Discrimination: Making the Most from Each Consumer

- Second-Degree Price Discrimination: Quantity Discounts

- Third-Degree Price Discrimination: Different Prices for Different
Market Segments

- Tying (Tie-In Sales), Bundling

- Advertising

## Uniform Price Vs. Price Discrimination

- A monopolist charges a uniform price if it sets the same price for every unit of output sold

- While the monopolist captures profits due to an optimal uniform pricing policy

    - It does not receive the consumer surplus or dead-weight loss associated with this policy

- A firm with market power may be able to increase its profits by charging more than one price for its product through price discrimination


## Forms of Price Discrimination

- A policy of first-degree (or perfect) price discrimination prices each unit sold at the consumer's maximum willingness to pay

    - This willingness to pay is directly observable by the monopolist

- A policy of second-degree price discrimination allows the monopolist to offer consumers a quantity discount

    - Two part tariffs

- A policy of third-degree price discrimination offers a different price for each segment of the market (or each consumer group) when membership in a segment can be observed

## Conditions

Certain market features must be present for a firm to capture more surplus with price discrimination:

@. A firm must have some market power to price-discriminate
    -  the demand curve the firm faces must be downward sloping
    - If the firm is a price taker it cannot set different prices for different units of output

## Conditions

@. The firm must have some information about the different amounts people will pay for its product
    - reservation prices or elasticities of demand across consumers

@. A firm must be able to prevent resale or arbitrage
    - A reseller might capture the surplus instead of the firm

## Willingness to Pay Curve

- The demand curve is the *willingness to pay* curve

- Since the demand curve slopes downward, the consumer buying the first unit is willing to pay a higher price than the consumer buying the second unit

- If the seller can perfectly implement first-degree price discrimination, it will price each unit at the maximum amount the consumer of that unit is willing to pay

## Uniform Price Vs. Price Discrimination

![](figures/ch12-1dpd.png){fig-align="center"}

## Pareto Efficiency

- The producer sells each unit to the consumer with the highest reservation price for that unit, at that price

- The monopolist will continue selling units until the reservation price exactly equals the marginal cost

- The producer captures all the surplus and there is no deadweight loss

- Perfect first-degree price discrimination therefore leads to an economically efficient level of output!

## Caveats

- In the real world, it is harder to learn about willingness to pay

- If you ask a customer about her willingness to pay, she will not reveal her reservation price
    - A consumer would like to tell you that she has a low willingness to pay so that she can capture some consumer surplus herself

## Caveats

- Often sellers can learn something about willingness to pay based on 
    - knowledge of where a person lives and works, 
    - how she dresses or speaks, 
    - the kind of car she drives, or 
    - how much money she makes

- The information may not perfectly reveal a consumer's willingness to pay, but it can help the seller to capture more surplus than it could without such information

## Uniform vs. 1st Degree Pricing

## Marginal Revenue Curve

- With uniform pricing, $MR=P+\frac{dP}{dQ}Q$

- With perfect first-degree price discrimination, only the first effect is present

- When the firm sells one more unit, it does not have to reduce its price on all the other units it is already selling

- So the marginal revenue curve with first-degree price discrimination is just $MR = P$

- The marginal revenue curve equals the demand curve

## Second Degree Price Discrimination

- A policy of second-degree price discrimination allows the monopolist to charge a different price to different consumers

- While different consumers pay different prices, the reservation price of any one consumer cannot be directly observed

## Second Degree Price Discrimination

- Sellers know that each customer's demand curve for a good is typically downward-sloping

    - the customer's willingness to pay decreases as successive units are purchased

- A seller may use this information to capture extra surplus by offering quantity discounts to consumers

- Not every form of quantity discounting represents price discrimination. Often sellers offer quantity discounts because it costs them less to sell a larger quantity

## Second Degree Price Discrimination

- One distinguishing feature of second-degree price discrimination is that the amount consumers pay for the good or service actually depends on two or more prices (parts)

- For example, telecommunication services work under a multipart tariff:
a subscription charge plus a usage charge

## Block Tariff

- If a consumer pays one price for one block of output and another price for another block of output, the consumer faces a block tariff

- Firm's objective is to maximize profits by choosing the optimizing quantity at each block (therefore looking for the optimal block price)

## Block Tariff

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="30%"}
- The monopolist might capture additional surplus by offering a quantity discount

- Charge a price for the first units (11) and a lower price (8) for any additional units

- What's the optimal block tariff?

## Average Outlay

Consumer's average expenditure, *average outlay*, is total expenditure $E$ divided by total quantity $Q$

In our previous example, 
$$
E = 
\begin{cases} 
\$14Q, & \text{if } Q \leq 6 \\
\$84 + \$8(Q-6), & \text{if } Q > 6 
\end{cases}
$$

So, the consumer's average outlay is
$$
\frac{E}{Q} = 
\begin{cases} 
\$14, & \text{if } Q \leq 6 \\
\frac{\$84 + \$8(Q-6)}{Q}, & \text{if } Q > 6 
\end{cases}
$$

## Average Outlay

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
- Second Degree Price Discrimination results in a **non-linear outlay schedule**

    - The average outlay changes as the number of units purchased changes

## Self Select

- The problem with first-degree price discrimination is that the high-willingness-to-pay person may *pretend* to be the low-willingness-to-pay person
    - The seller might not tell them apart effectively

- By offering two different price-quantity packages in the market,   
    - one targeted to the high-demand and the other targeted to the low-demand person, 
    - the seller might induce the consumers to choose the package meant for them: **self select**

## Subscription and Usage Tariff

- A monopolist charges a two-part tariff if it charges a per unit fee, $r$, plus a lump sum fee (paid whether or not a positive number of units is consumed), $F$

$$
    T=F+rQ
$$

- This, effectively, charges demanders of a low quantity a different
average price than demanders of a high quantity

- Example: include hook-up charge plus usage fee for a telephone, club membership, and so on

## Subscription and Usage Tariff

- All customers are identical

    - P = 100 - Q

    - MC = AC = 10

- What is the optimal two-part tariff?

- Two steps: [Draw graph on the board]{.small}

    - Maximize the benefits to the consumers by charging r = MC = 10

    - Capture this benefit by setting F = consumer benefits = 4050


## Subscription and Usage Tariff

- Any higher usage charge would result in a dead-weight loss that could not be captured by the monopolist

- Any lower usage charge would result in selling at less than marginal cost

- In essence, the monopolist maximizes the surplus, then
sets the lump sum fee to capture the entire surplus for itself

- The total surplus captured is the same as in the case of perfect price discrimination

## In the Real World

- In the real world, the firm cannot so easily capture all the surplus, for two reasons:

1. Demand differs from one consumer to the next. High subscription and usage tariffs might capture more surplus from large-demand consumers, but small-demand consumers will not buy the service at all

2. The firm cannot tell apart large from small-demand consumers. Firms need to offer customers a menu of subscription and usage charges to incentivize them to self-select

## Third Degree Price Discrimination

- If a firm can identify different consumer groups, or segments, in a market and can estimate each segment's demand curve, the firm can practice third-degree price discrimination by setting a profit-maximizing price for each segment

- Example: Movie ticket sales to senior citizens or students at a discount

- How does a monopolist maximize profit with this type of price
discrimination?

## Third Degree Price Discrimination

The optimal pricing maximizes the monopolist's profits
$$
\max_{Q_1,Q_2} P_1(Q_1)Q_1 + P_2(Q_2)Q_2- C(Q_1+Q_2)
$$

$P_i(Q_i)$ denote the inverse demand curves of group $i$

## Third Degree Price Discrimination: Optimal Pricing

The optimal solution must have
$$
\begin{aligned}
    MR_1(Q_1)&=MC(Q_1+Q_2) \\
    MR_2(Q_2)&=MC(Q_1+Q_2)
\end{aligned}
$$

- The marginal cost of producing an extra unit of output must be equal to the marginal revenue in **each** market

## Third Degree Price Discrimination: Optimal Pricing

- In other words, the monopolist maximizes total profits by maximizing profits from each group individually

- Since marginal cost is the same in each market, $MR_1=MR_2=MC$

- Otherwise, the monopolist could raise revenues by switching sales
from the low MR group to the high MR group

## Third Degree Price Discrimination

![](book-figures/c12/c12f007.png){fig-align="center"}

## Third Degree Price Discrimination

- Note that the price is higher in the lower elasticity demand than in the high elasticity demand

- A firm that price discriminates will set a low price for the price-sensitive group and a high price for the group that is relatively price-insensitive

- Senior citizens and students are more likely to be price-sensitive than the average consumer

## Third Degree Price Discrimination

$$
\begin{aligned}
    P_1\left(1-\frac{1}{ |\epsilon_{Q_1,P_1}| }\right)&=MC(Q_1+Q_2) \\
    P_2\left(1-\frac{1}{ |\epsilon_{Q_2,P_2}| }\right)&=MC(Q_1+Q_2)
\end{aligned}
$$

if $P_1>P_2$, then we must have

$$
\begin{aligned}
1-\frac{1}{ |\epsilon_{Q_1,P_1}| } &< 1-\frac{1}{ |\epsilon_{Q_2,P_2}| } \\
\implies |\epsilon_{Q_2,P_2}| &> |\epsilon_{Q_1,P_1}|
\end{aligned}
$$


[The market with the higher price must have the lower price elasticity of demand.]{.small}


## Examples {.nonincremental}

- Consumer surplus (Ex. 12.22)

- Inverse elasticity pricing (LBD 12.5)

- Capacity constraints (LBD 12.6)


## Screening

Sorting consumers based on a consumer characteristic that 

1. is observable by the firm (age,status) and 

1. strongly related to a consumer unobserved characteristic that the firm would like to know (willingness to pay; elasticity of demand)

- Screening Mechanisms: 

    - Intertemporal Price Discrimination [(Telephone, highest during peak demand, daytime)]{.small}
    - Coupons and Rebates [(People who collect coupons is likely to be more price-sensitive)]{.small}

## Implementing Price Discrimination

- Problem: High-demand consumers might buy at a price targeting low-demand consumers [Ex.: Coupons easily available to everyone]{.small}

- How can the firm ensure that 
    - consumers who are targeted to pay the high price, pay the high price; and 
    - consumers who are targeted to pay the low price, pay the low price?

## Example

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="30%"}
- Two market segments
    - Beta: price-sensitive
    - Alpha: less price-sensitive
- Same quality [Quality: Product performance, amount of hassle]{.small}
:::
::: {.column width="70%"}
![](figures/ch12-fence-a.png){fig-align="center" width="100%"}
:::
:::: 

## Example

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="30%"}
- Alpha consumers might buy at the low price
    - if low-price version is readily available
- Exploit: Less price-sensitive consumers are more quality-sensitive
:::
::: {.column width="70%"}
![](figures/ch12-fence-b.png){fig-align="center" width="100%"}
:::
:::: 


## Building a *Fence*

- Keep the less price-sensitive consumers from being able and/or willing to purchase the low-price version of the good

- Beta consumers are better off; they prefer C rather than B. They also prefer C to A

- Alpha consumers prefer A to C. Thus, they will purchase the high-price high-quality version

- By reducing the quality of the low-price offer, the firm makes the low-price version unattractive for alpha consumers
    - Beta consumers are more tolerant of quality degradations, they choose the low-quality version

## Versioning

- A strategy of selling two (or more) versions of the product with different quality levels at different prices

- **Damaged goods** strategy, a firm creates a low-end version of its full-priced good by deliberately damaging the product

    - Removing features or reducing performance
    - Damaging the product might increase the marginal cost of producing the damaged good
    - The cost differential is worth incurring if the gain in profits, resulting from implementing the price discrimination scheme, is greater

## Tying (Tie-in Sales)

- A sales practice that allows a customer to buy one product (the tying product) only if that customer agrees to buy another product (the tied product)

- Often, tying is used when customers differ by the frequency with which they wish to use a product

- Tying often enables a firm to extend its market power from the tying product to the tied product


## Bundling

- A type of tie-in sale in which a firm requires customers who buy one of its products to simultaneously buy another of its products

- Bundling can increase profits when 
    - customers have different tastes (different willingnesses to pay) for the two products and when 
    - the firm cannot price discriminate

- But bundling does not always pay

## Bundling: Negatively Correlated Preferences


|   | Computer | Monitor |
|:--:|:--------:|:-------:|
|Consumer 1| \$1,200 | \$600 |
|Consumer 2| \$1,500 | \$400 |
|MC        | \$1,000 | \$300 |
: Willingness to Pay

- Without bundling: Pc = \$1500 Pm = \$600 ; Profit cm = \$800

- With bundling: Pb = \$1800; Profit b = \$1000

## Bundling: Positively Correlated Preferences

|   | Computer | Monitor |
|:--:|:--------:|:-------:|
|Consumer 1| \$1,200 | \$400 |
|Consumer 2| \$1,500 | \$600 |
|MC        | \$1,000 | \$300 |
: Willingness to Pay

- Without bundling: pc = \$1500  pm = \$600; Profit cm = \$800

- With bundling: pb = \$2100; Profit b = \$800

## Mixed Bundling

|   | Computer | Monitor |
|:--:|:--------:|:-------:|
|Consumer 1| \$900 | \$800 |
|Consumer 2| \$1,100 | \$600 |
|Consumer 2| \$1,300 | \$400 |
|Consumer 2| \$1,500 | \$200 |
|MC        | \$1,000 | \$300 |
: Willingness to Pay

## Bundling

- In general, bundling a pair of goods only pays if their demands are
negatively correlated

- Customers who are willing to pay relatively more for good A are not
willing to pay as much for good B

- The reason is that the price is determined by the purchaser with the lowest reservation price

- If reservation prices for the two goods are negatively correlated,
bundling reduces the dispersion of reservation prices and so raises the price at which additional units can be sold

## Effects of Advertising

- The firm can capture surplus using nonprice strategies such as
advertising

- When the firm does not advertise, its maximum profit is areas I + II

- When the firms spends A~1~ dollars on advertising, its maximum profit is areas II + III
